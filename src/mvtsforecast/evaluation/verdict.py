"""Pure-function verdict derivation: ``deep_beats_naive``.

The headline verdict is a PURE FUNCTION of the inference outputs. It CANNOT read
``True`` ("a deep model beats the naive random walk") unless a deep model beats
naive with a Diebold-Mariano-significant margin AND a positive Deflated Sharpe.
This is what keeps the README honest on noisy daily returns, where the documented,
literature-consistent outcome is that PatchTST / the interpretable transformer /
the LSTM do NOT reliably beat a naive baseline: the verdict is derived from the
evidence, never narrated. The truth table is unit-tested.

There is NO price-level R² anywhere in this layer.

Importing this module has no side effects.

        The Deflated Sharpe (FULL-grid ``n_trials``) of the best deep model.

    r"""Derive the headline ``deep_beats_naive`` verdict (pure function).

    Decision rule (truth-table unit-tested): ``deep_beats_naive`` is ``True`` iff
    ALL of the following hold for the best deep model:

    1. the Diebold-Mariano test is significant (``dm_pvalue < alpha``);
    2. the DM statistic is signed in the model's favour (``dm_statistic < 0`` —
       strictly lower squared-error loss than the naive forecast);
    3. the Deflated Sharpe is strictly positive (``deflated_sharpe > 0`` against
       the multiplicity-inflated benchmark with ``n_effective_trials``).

    If ANY of the three fails, the verdict is
    :attr:`Verdict.NO_SIGNIFICANT_DIFFERENCE` — the expected outcome on noisy
    daily returns. This function MUST NOT return :attr:`Verdict.DEEP_BEATS_NAIVE`
    while the DM test is insignificant or the DSR is non-positive, regardless of
    any point estimate. The verdict is a deterministic consequence of the
    evidence, never a narrative choice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    best_deep_model:
        Name of the best-performing (lowest-RMSE) deep model.
    dm_statistic:
        The Diebold-Mariano statistic of the best deep model vs. naive
        (negative favours the model).
    dm_pvalue:
        The two-sided DM p-value of the best deep model vs. naive.
    deflated_sharpe:
        The Deflated Sharpe (FULL-grid ``n_trials``) of the best deep model.
    n_effective_trials:
        The honest multiplicity count (#architectures x #HP configs).
    alpha:
        Significance level for the DM test (default ``0.05``).
