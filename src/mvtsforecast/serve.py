"""Serve entrypoints the backend calls (onnxruntime + numpy + statsmodels, NO torch).

The FastAPI router calls :func:`run_forecast` to compare the models on the
synthetic panel (or a real basket loaded via the CLI path) and return a JSON-safe
summary plus two Plotly figures. The naive and ARIMA baselines are computed LIVE
(pure numpy / statsmodels); the deep models (LSTM, PatchTST, the interpretable
transformer) are served from their committed ONNX artifacts via onnxruntime —
torch is NEVER imported. The honest ``deep_beats_naive`` verdict is the PURE
function of the inference outputs.

The committed offline-trained metrics may also be read from
``artifacts/metrics.json`` so the deployed default returns instantly without
re-running the deep forward pass; either way the request path NEVER trains.

Importing this module has no side effects (onnxruntime / statsmodels are imported
lazily inside the deep / ARIMA paths).
